# First_Project
This is my first testing repository. Hello, my name is Joshua. My future goals are to build an empire and get better at my coding so that I can build a company on building buildings using technology called Build Forge.

I enjoy playing sports like soccer and volleyball, as well as watching anime. I also enjoy playing video games and coding.

I am a rising senior at the Newark School of Data Science and Information Technology. At my school, we use coding in are everyday life, such as classwork and homework. My school provides us with lots of technology certifications, like a cybersecurity certification.

I'm also attending the KKCF program where they teach us coding and using that coding in are future jobs and business companies.
